# sekweltauntpack

This is a collection of taunts for [Prop Hunt: Enhanced](https://github.com/prop-hunt-enhanced/prop-hunt-enhanced) that is full of memes, YTP and basically anything that my friends find to be funny. If you use it and want to suggest your own, just name them in the comments on the Steam workshop page at https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2054840052.

**NOTE**: This addon does modify the file in PH:E that is responsible for sorting the taunts list Numbered taunts appear in order while text-based taunts (which this addon adds) appear in random order AFTER the numbered ones. At first glance this doesn't seem to cause errors with other aspects of the gamemode.
